## Access the Project

In order to view this project properly, it is ideal to access the following github page, as it allows for the website's full functionality to be executed, especially the cookie feature;

https://alphaura.github.io/Betsson-Git/

This is the github repo should it be needed https://github.com/alphaura/Betsson-Git

## Responsiveness

    The project is fully responsive starting from mobile all the way to desktop size, so that the user can view all aspects of the site, in any device size they wish.

    The links within this site, are also all linked to their respective pages based on the main site betsson.es, except for the "Ajustes de Cookies" button in the footer page, so that the replication of the homepage is also closer to the original site.

## Cookies

    Upon opening the project, you will see a cookie feature asking you to accept its terms, along with the cookie policy and information about it. Once the user accepts the cookie, it will then be
    be stored in the browser, and will expire within 2 days.

    Once it's stored, the cookie will not appear unless it is either deleted or expired.

## Menu Section

### Mobile

    On mobile, you have two menus. The top menu provides login and registration options and offers a drop-down menu to access other parts of the main website. The bottom fixed menu directly links to Casino, Ruletas, Apuestas, and Promo pages.

    For the top drop down menu section, in order to close an opened selection, the user needs to click once more on it in order to close it.

### Desktop

    On desktop on the other hand, you have the mobile's bottom menu features including the "Blog" page in the top menu alongside the FAQ's, login and register buttons.

## Hero Section

    In the hero section, I have used the overflow method while giving the images a 100% width, so that they take the full width of the page since they are their to promote features of the site. The CTA button changes from desktop to mobile size, to keep it inline with good design.

## Registration Steps

    The registration steps are their as a small guide and also prompt for the user to register an account with Betsson.

## Promotions Section

    The promotion section changes from being static on desktop with a box-shadow on hover, to a more dynamic section, having an invisible scrollbar to make the design cleaner. On mobile there's also an option to see all promotions option, by clicking on the "Ver Todos", that appears on the promotions section upon screen size is resized smaller.

## Featured Games

    The featured games or the "Destacados" section, features the same invisible scrollbar feature on mobile size to keep the design clean, however, on bigger device sizes, since their are 12 games in the highlight section, to neatly position them, I have used GRID so that they have 4 columns and 3 rows, and the user can choose whichever featured game they wish.

## Accessing the Games

- In order to access the featured games on desktop, the user simply needs to hover over the game they like, and press on "Entrar" which will direct them to the game.

- Similar to the desktop as the hover feature remains, but on mobile the user needs to click once on the desired game, which will then make the "Entrar" button appear, and same as above, upon clicking on "Entrar", the user will be directed to the chosen game.

## About Betsson

    The about Betsson section grows in width from mobile to desktop, which once it reaches a specified width, this will stop growing in order to stay inline with the design width consistency.

    For the more information or "Mas Informaci√≥n" section, I have used the <details> and <summary> tag in order to create this drop down feature which holds the rest of the information about Betsson.

## Footer Section

## Footer Menu

### Mobile

    On mobile, the footer menu shows only 2 columns due to the size, however, they remain fully responsive to the smallest device size and do not break or overlap each other.

### Desktop

    On desktop, the footer menu shows all of the 5 menu features their are on Betsson.es, nicely balanced in sizes, width and as well as fully responsive going from two columns to 5 columns.

## Payment & RG

### Payment

    The payment methods are all linked to have the scrollbar set back to the top upon a method is clicked, and the login popup will also appear, prompting the user to log into their account.

### RG

    The RG section will direct the user to the respective link, depending on which image is clicked

## Partner Section

    In the final part of the footer, there are a few more RG links to aid the user in responsible gambling, extra information about the Betsson company and also the display of the partner of the company, being fully visible both on mobile and desktop.
